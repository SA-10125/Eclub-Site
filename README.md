# The Entrepreneurship Club

## I am working on adding feautures to this website.

The **Entrepreneurship Club** is for those who dream beyond the rational limits and for those who seek to make it a reality. 

- **Founded:** November 02, 2019

## About this Club

We gather and nurture the spirited individuals in the engineering community by kindling their entrepreneurial mindset. The club aims to establish a peer network of students who are inclined towards entrepreneurship and help them connect with the relevant stakeholders through events, associations, and more.

We provide a platform for students to explore their entrepreneurial potential, engage in discussions, participate in events, and access opportunities for growth and networking. Our mission is to create an ecosystem where budding entrepreneurs can thrive and turn their ideas into reality.
